# Kea DHCP Server Monitoring Project Status

## Project Overview

This project implements an eBPF-based monitoring solution for tracking performance metrics of the Kea DHCP server. The solution has been modified to work with Infoblox's Dras client running on macOS rather than generating traffic locally.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Core eBPF Monitoring**
   - âœ… Created `kea_metrics.c` eBPF program for tracking Kea DHCP server metrics
   - âœ… Fixed memory handling and data structure issues in eBPF code
   - âœ… Created `kea_metrics.py` to load and attach eBPF probes to Kea functions
   - âœ… Successfully attached 8 eBPF probes to key Kea functions

2. **Traffic Generation**
   - âœ… Updated to work with macOS Dras client instead of local traffic generation
   - âœ… Created `dras_wrapper.py` for easier usage of Dras client on macOS
   - âœ… Added cross-platform compatibility in scripts
   - âœ… Removed direct traffic generation code that's no longer needed

3. **Metrics Visualization**
   - âœ… Created `visualize_metrics.py` to generate histogram charts of collected metrics
   - âœ… Added proper labeling for different metric types
   - âœ… Added summary visualization showing all collected metrics
   - âœ… Added attribution of data source (macOS Dras client traffic)

4. **Server Management**
   - âœ… Implemented proper signal handling for clean termination
   - âœ… Created `troubleshoot_kea_server.py` to diagnose server connectivity issues
   - âœ… Added automatic detection of server IP for better Dras client instructions
   - âœ… Added check for macOS Dras client reachability

5. **Documentation**
   - âœ… Detailed README with instructions for both Linux server and macOS client
   - âœ… Clear workflow steps for cross-platform monitoring
   - âœ… Command-line reference for all tools
   - âœ… Troubleshooting guide

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the full monitoring solution
   - Create usage guides for troubleshooting common issues
   - Add installation instructions for dependencies

## Current Setup
- Kea DHCP server running on 10.211.55.4:67
- 8 eBPF probes successfully attached to key functions
- Traffic generation scripts sending packets but no responses received
- Visualization tools working with sample data

## Usage Instructions
```bash
# Run monitoring only
sudo python3 kea_metrics.py

# Generate DHCP traffic
sudo python3 send_raw_dhcp.py 10

# Run monitoring with traffic generation
sudo python3 run_kea_monitoring.py -t 60

# Visualize collected metrics
python3 visualize_metrics.py sample_metrics.txt
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- BCC (BPF Compiler Collection)
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- Root privileges for eBPF and network operations

## Pending Tasks

1. **Testing**
   - ðŸ”„ Test the complete monitoring solution with Infoblox's Dras client from macOS
   - ðŸ”„ Validate data collection across different load patterns
   - ðŸ”„ Test with various DHCP server configurations

2. **Advanced Features**
   - ðŸ“‹ Set up persistent storage for collected metrics (InfluxDB, Prometheus)
   - ðŸ“‹ Create automated alerts or thresholds for key metrics
   - ðŸ“‹ Integrate with other monitoring tools or dashboards
   - ðŸ“‹ Improve automatic detection of function addresses in different Kea versions
   - ðŸ“‹ Add support for IPv6 DHCP monitoring

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - ðŸ“‹ Optimize eBPF code for lower overhead
   - ðŸ“‹ Add more granular profiling capabilities
   - ðŸ“‹ Add resource usage monitoring of the monitoring tools themselves

4. **User Experience**
   - ðŸ“‹ Create a web interface for real-time monitoring
   - ðŸ“‹ Add configuration profiles for different monitoring scenarios
   - ðŸ“‹ Improve visualization with interactive graphs

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. Function discovery in stripped binaries
2. Cross-platform workflow between Linux and macOS
3. Non-invasive monitoring of Kea DHCP server
4. Visualization of histogram-based metrics
5. Handling connection between macOS Dras client and Linux server

## Next Steps

The immediate next step is to thoroughly test the solution with a real macOS machine running the Infoblox Dras client against a production Kea DHCP server. This will validate our cross-platform approach and identify any remaining issues or opportunities for improvement.

Long-term, integrating the metrics into a time-series database and creating a Grafana dashboard would provide a more production-ready monitoring solution with historical data analysis capabilities.
