# eBPF Monitoring Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **404 Errors for Missing Visualizations**
   - The dashboard was trying to load visualization images before they were created
   - This resulted in 404 (Not Found) errors appearing in the console
   - The dashboard had an empty appearance until the first metrics collection completed

2. **Dashboard Initialization Sequence**
   - The dashboard sometimes launched before any visualizations were available
   - Users would see a broken dashboard until the first data collection cycle completed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Placeholder Images for Visualizations

- Added robust placeholder image creation functionality:
  - Uses PIL/Pillow library when available to create informative placeholder images
  - Falls back to simple 1x1 transparent PNG when PIL is not available
  - Provides clear "Waiting for data..." messages for each visualization type
  - Placeholders are created before dashboard is launched

### 2. Improved Dashboard HTML with Error Handling

- Updated the dashboard HTML with:
  - Better error handling for missing images
  - CSS placeholders for visualizations that aren't ready
  - Status messages to show data collection progress
  - Cache-busting techniques to ensure browser refreshes with new data
  - Clearer labels and layout improvements

### 3. Custom HTTP Server Handler

- Implemented improved HTTP server handler:
  - Special handling for 404 errors on image requests
  - Returns transparent PNG instead of 404 error page for missing images
  - Reduces error logging to avoid console clutter
  - Only logs actual errors, not expected 404s during startup

### 4. Dashboard Preload Option

- Added a new `--dashboard-preload` command line option:
  - Starts the dashboard immediately with placeholder images
  - Dashboard is loaded before first data collection cycle
  - User can see the dashboard structure while waiting for real data
  - Improved user experience by removing waiting period

### 5. Better Browser Cache Control

- Added cache invalidation techniques:
  - Appends timestamp comments to image files
  - Uses query parameters for cache-busting in JavaScript
  - Forces browser to reload the latest image instead of using a cached version

## Usage

The dashboard can now be started with:

```bash
./run_realtime_dashboard.sh
```

The dashboard will open immediately with placeholder images and update automatically as metrics are collected.

## Configuration Options

The eBPF monitoring script now supports these dashboard-related options:

- `--dashboard`: Enable the real-time visualization dashboard
- `--dashboard-port <port>`: Specify the HTTP port (default: 8000)
- `--dashboard-preload`: Start the dashboard with placeholders before first data collection
- `--viz-dir <path>`: Specify a custom directory for visualizations

## Dependencies

- Python's built-in `http.server` module
- Optional: PIL/Pillow for enhanced placeholder images
