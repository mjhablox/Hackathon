## Slide 2: Overview & Problem
- **Challenge:**
  - Need real-time monitoring of Kea DHCP server performance
  - Must collect metrics without modifying source code
  - Need efficient storage and visualization of metrics data

- **Solution:**
  - eBPF-based monitoring system with Netflix Hollow integration
  - Real-time dashboard with multiple visualization options
  - Resilient architecture with fallback mechanisms

---

## Slide 3: Technology Stack
- **eBPF Technology:**
  - Attaches probes to Kea DHCP server functions
  - Collects metrics with minimal overhead
  - Monitors: packet processing times, CPU/memory usage, error rates

- **Netflix Hollow Integration:**
  - Efficient in-memory data storage
  - Fast data access and versioning
  - Structured metrics schema

---

## Slide 4: System Architecture
- **Components & Data Flow:**
  - eBPF Probes → Raw Metrics → JSON → Hollow Format → Dashboard
  - Core monitoring: kea_metrics.c/.py
  - Data processing: ebpf_to_json.py, ebpf_to_hollow.py
  - Continuous monitoring: ebpf_hollow_monitor.py
  - Visualization: Real-time dashboard

- **Resilient Design:**
  - Local mode when Hollow server is unavailable
  - Sample metrics fallback (when needed)
  - Automatic dashboard recovery

---

## Slide 5: Resilient Architecture
- **Fallback Mechanisms:**
  - Local mode when Hollow server is unavailable
  - Sample metrics when collection fails
  - Automatic dashboard recovery

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**
  - Clear logging of system state
  - Graceful degradation when components fail
  - Fixed working directory issue in metrics collection

---

## Slide 6: Demo & Usage
- **Running the System:**
  ```bash
  # Start the demo with default settings
  ./run_demo.sh
  ```

- **Key Features to Observe:**
  - Real-time metrics at http://localhost:8080/
  - Automatic fallback mechanisms in action
  - Graceful handling of collection failures

---

## Slide 7: Real-World Benefits
- **Operational Advantages:**
  - Early detection of performance issues
  - Non-invasive monitoring (no code changes)
  - Production-ready monitoring solution
  - Clear visibility into system performance

- **Use Cases:**
  - DevOps continuous monitoring
  - Performance troubleshooting
  - Capacity planning
  - Production DHCP server monitoring

---

## Slide 8: Conclusion & Next Steps
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - eBPF + Netflix Hollow provides powerful, efficient monitoring
  - Resilient architecture ensures reliable operation
  - Easy to deploy and use in various environments

- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Additional eBPF probe points
  - Integration with alerting systems
  - Enhanced visualization options
